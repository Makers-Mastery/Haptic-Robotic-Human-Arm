# Introduction
Hello! My name is Elijah, a high school senior going into college and a budding robotics engineer. This is the most advanced project I've made to date, as a way to push myself in learning robotics and electrical engineering. This is the repository for my full scale adaptive human arm, hapic glove, and exo-arm. The project files for the arm, hand, and exo-arm are courtesy of youbionic and the haptic glove (originally designed for VR but repurposed as a control device for my arm) is courtesy of Lucas VRTech on YouTube. The code is written for the ESP32 Development Board, using the ESPNow protcol for wireless communication (see Credits for more details).
